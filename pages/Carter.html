    My favorite animals are dogs. 
    I know that this is a pretty Generic choice but I just like them. 
    I grew up around dogs all the time and I think that they are a great animal if you just need a friend. 
    I had a very rough childhood and I had a dog named Toby. 
    He was alot bigger than me but he was like a brother to me in a wierd sort of way.
     I probably wouldnt have made it through the stuff that I did go through without a friend like Toby.
      Dogs just have a special place in my heart.
